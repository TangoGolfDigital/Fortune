Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach
maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to
tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas
and differences in life forms.

To be different is not necessarily to be ugly;
to have a different idea is not necessarily to be wrong.
The worst possible thing is for all of us to begin to look
and talk and act and think alike.

If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences,
to take a positive delight in those small differences between
our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to
go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost
certainly out there.

If man is to survive, he will have learned to take a delight
in the essential differences between men and between cultures.
He will learn that differences in ideas and attitudes are a
delight, part of life's exciting variety, not something to fear.

Science knows still practically nothing about the real nature
of matter, energy, dimension, or time; and even less about those
remarkable things called life and thought.
But whatever the meaning and purpose of this universe,
you are a legitimate part of it.

I believe in humanity.
We are an incredible species.
We're still just a child creature, we're still being nasty to each other.
And all children go through those phases.
We're growing up, we're moving into adolescence now.
When we grow up - man, we're going to be something!

It is the struggle itself that is most important.
We must strive to be more than we are.
It does not matter that we will not reach our ultimate goal.
The effort itself yields its own reward.

It isn't all over; everything has not been invented;
the human adventure is just beginning.

The human race is a remarkable creature, one with great potential,
and I hope that 'Star Trek' has helped to show us what we can be
if we believe in ourselves and our abilities.

Our prime obligation to ourselves is to make the unknown known.
We are on a journey to keep an appointment with whatever we are.

What I will take credit for is, I surrounded myself by very bright
people who came up with all those wonderful things.
And then you can appear very smart.

That's been a question, one of the big questions in my life.
'What is a human?' What are the elements that make a human?'
It's a search for...how many elements do you get before you say,
'Yes, it's human,' where before you were saying it's not human.

You can't study evolution, particularly the evolution of humanity,
that you don't see that it's getting better and better.

Its seems to me - it's likely that heaven's here right now.
If you could take life with its pain and misery, where you fail
and you sometimes win, and if you package it into a game,
people would pay a fortune to have this game.
And I don't know that I'd want it to be resolved so peacefully
that the game would be all over.

In a better world, I can do anything.
I'll be there in a better world.
In a better world, they will not laugh
at me or look down their nose at me.

We must learn not just to accept differences between ourselves
and our ideas, but to enthusiastically welcome and enjoy them.

Ancient astronauts didn't build the pyramids.
Human beings built the pyramids,
because they're clever and they work hard.

Reality is incredibly larger, infinitely more exciting,
than the flesh and blood vehicle we travel in here.
If you read science fiction, the more you read it the
more you realize that you and the universe are part of
the same thing.

Star Trek says that it has not all happened,
it has not all been discovered,
that tomorrow can be as challenging
and adventurous as any time man has ever lived.

Diversity contains as many treasures as those waiting
for us on other worlds. We will find it impossible to
fear diversity and to enter the future at the same time.

Since you are part of the all that is, part of its purpose,
there is more to you than just this brief speck of existence.
You are just a visitor here in this time and this place,
a traveler through it.
