Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't
matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if
you go into it deeply enough.

Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined,
irreverent and original manner possible.

You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you
ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect
me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.

I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of
something and knowing something.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the
easiest person to fool.

Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.

The highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and
human compassion.

Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is.

I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have
answers which might be wrong.

I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that
can't be questioned.

We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because
only in that way can we find progress.

I'm smart enough to know that I'm dumb.

If you thought that science was certain - well, that is just an error
on your part.

You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but
when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about
the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's
what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the
name of something and knowing something.

What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics
students in the third or fourth year of graduate school... It is my
task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand
it. You see my physics students don't understand it... That is because
I don't understand it. Nobody does.

There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge
number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national
deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call
them economical numbers.

For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public
relations, for nature cannot be fooled.

I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by
understanding, they learn by some other way — by rote or
something. Their knowledge is so fragile!

We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not
unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of
thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we
can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.

Never confuse education with intelligence.  
Intelligence isn't the ability to remember and repeat, like they 
teach you in school. Intelligence is the ability to learn from 
experience, solve problems, and use our knowledge to adapt to new situations.
