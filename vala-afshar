What is investment?
Usain Bolt won 8 gold medals in 3 Olympics, and he only ran 
for less than 115 seconds on the track, earning $119 million 
dollars. That’s economy of effort.
But for those 2 minutes, he trained for 20 years. 
That’s investment. Think long term. Patience pays.

You can spend a lifetime to build a good reputation and then
ruin your efforts with less than 280 characters.
Be mindful of what you share. Be less judgmental and mean
spirited. Do not belittle people. And if given a choice between
clever or kind, always choose kind. Be kind.

Have the courage to stand behind your words. Do not speak to 
freedom of speech while ignoring accountability. 
You are the sum of your thoughts, words and actions. Have the
courage to speak with honesty, integrity and clarity.

You will not remember how much money you made throughout your
career. However, you will remember every person that opened a
career door for you.  Opening doors for others is important and
meaningful work. Be a door opener. Be remembered.

When a toxic person can no longer control you, 
they will try to control how others see you.
The misinformation will feel unfair, but stay above it, 
trusting that other people will eventually see the truth, just like you did.
Be brave, be honest, stand tall and stay above it.

You are not your parents.
You are not a school diploma.
You are not your credit score.
You are not your job.
You are not the clothes you wear.
You are not the size of your network.
You are not your house or neighborhood.
You are the sum of your words, choices, and actions.
