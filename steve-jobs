I always advise people – Don’t wait! Do something when you are young,
when you have nothing to lose, and keep that in mind.

That’s why we started Apple, we said you know, we have absolutely
nothing to lose. I was 20 years old at the time, Woz was 24-25, so we
have nothing to lose. We have no families, no children, no houses. Woz
had an old car. I had a Volkswagen van, I mean, all we were going to
lose is our cars and the shirts off our back.

Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The
troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see
things differently. They’re not fond of rules, and they have no
respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them,
glorify and vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore
them because they change things. They push the human race forward. And
while some may see them as crazy, we see genius. Because the people
who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones
who do.

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: ‘If you live
each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be
right.’ It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33
years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If
today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about
to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘no’ for too many days
in a row, I know I need to change something.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way

When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is

bash into walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun,

broader than that.

On being fired from Apple and called back 12 years later: What a
circle of life. You know? Life is just always mysterious and

We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be
really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then
you die, you know…

So this is what we’ve chosen to do with our life. We could be sitting
in a monastery somewhere in Japan. We could be out sailing. Some of
the executive team could be playing golf. They could be running other

better be damn good. It better be worth it. And we think it is.

In business, if I knew earlier what I know now, I’d have probably done
some things a lot better than I did, but I also would’ve probably done
some other things a lot worse. But so what? It’s more important to be

I think death is the most wonderful invention of life. It purges the
system of these old models that are obsolete.
- Steve Jobs
%
Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And
that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best
invention of life. It is life’s change agent, it clears out the old to
make way for the new.
- Steve Jobs

I’ve always felt that death is the greatest invention of life. I’m
sure that life evolved without death at first and found that without
death, life didn’t work very well because it didn’t make room for the
young.

People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you’re doing and
it’s totally true. And the reason is because it’s so hard that if you
don’t, any rational person would give up. It’s really hard. And you
have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you don’t love
it, if you’re not having fun doing it, you don’t really love it,
you’re going to give up.
- Steve Jobs

If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being
“successful” in the eyes of society and the ones that didn’t,
oftentimes, it’s the ones who were successful and loved what they did
so they could persevere, you know, when it got really tough. And the
ones that didn’t love it quit because they’re sane, right? Who would
want to put up with this stuff if you don’t love it?
- Steve Jobs
%
So it’s a lot of hard work and it’s a lot of worrying constantly and
if you don’t love it, you’re going to fail. So you’ve got to love it
and you’ve got to have passion and I think that’s the high-order bit.
- Steve Jobs
%
I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful
entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance. It is
so hard. You put so much of your life into this thing. There are such
rough moments in time that I think most people give up. I don’t blame
them. It’s really tough and it consumes your life.

I’ve read something that Bill Gates said about six months ago. He
said, ‘I worked really, really hard in my 20s.’ And I know what he
means because I worked really, really hard in my 20s too. Literally,
you know, 7 days a week, a lot of hours every day. And it actually is
a wonderful thing to do, because you can get a lot done. But you can’t
do it forever, and you don’t want to do it forever, and you have to
come up with ways of figuring out what the most important things are
and working with other people even more.

On the MacIntosh: When we finally presented it at the shareholders’

actually finished it. Everyone started crying.

On his father: He was a machinist by trade and worked very hard and
was kind of a genius with his hands. He had a workbench out in his
garage where, when I was about five or six, he sectioned off a little
piece of it and said “Steve, this is your workbench now.” And he gave
me some of his smaller tools and showed me how to use a hammer and saw
and how to build things. It really was very good for me. He spent a
lot of time with me… teaching me how to build things, how to take
things apart, put things back together.

I can tell you this: I’ve been married for 8 years, and that’s had a
really good influence on me. I’ve been very lucky, through random
happenstance I just happened to sit next to this wonderful woman who

big deal. You see the world differently.

I’ve never been so tired in my life. I’d come home at about ten
o’clock at night and flop straight into bed, then haul myself out at

kept the family together with a husband in absentia.

I feel like somebody just punched me in the stomach and knocked all my

We’ve done so many hardware products where Jony and I have looked at
each other and said, ‘We don’t know how to make it any better than

we look at the older thing and go, ‘How can we ever have done that?’

When I was 12 or 13, I wanted to build something and I needed some
parts, so I picked up the phone and called Bill Hewlett – he was
listed in the Palo Alto phone book. He answered the phone and he was
real nice. He chatted with me for, like, 20 minutes. He didn’t know me
at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that
summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency
counters. Assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It
didn’t matter; I was in heaven.

I’ve never found anyone who’s said no or hung up the phone when I

Ever since I’ve had cancer, I’ve been thinking about it more. And I
find myself believing a bit more. I kind of – maybe it’s ’cause I want
to believe in an afterlife. That when you die, it doesn’t just all
disappear. The wisdom you’ve accumulated. Somehow it lives on, but
sometimes I think it’s just like an on-off switch. Click and you’re
gone. And that’s why I don’t like putting on-off switches on Apple

Fortunately, my training has been in doing things that take a long

there the rest of my life. So I’m a long-term kind of person.

I have been trained to think in units of time that are measured in
several years. With what I’ve chosen to do with my life, you know,
even a small thing takes a few years. To do anything of magnitude
takes at least five years, more likely seven or eight. Rightfully or
wrongfully, that’s how I think.

I’m a tool builder. That’s how I think of myself. I want to build
really good tools that I know in my gut and my heart will be
valuable. And then, whatever happens, is… you can’t really predict
exactly what will happen, but you can feel the direction that we’re
going. And that’s about as close as you can get. Then you just stand
back and get out of the way, and these things take on a life of their

Another priority was to make Apple more entrepreneurial and
startup-like. So we immediately reorganized, drastically narrowed the
product line, and changed compensation for senior managers so they get
a lot of stock but no cash bonuses. The upshot is that the place feels

One of the keys to Apple is Apple’s an incredibly collaborative

one person’s in charge of iPhone hardware engineering, another

Most of the time, we’re taking things. Neither you nor I made the

It’s hard to tell with these Internet startups if they’re really
interested in building companies or if they’re just interested in the

My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept
